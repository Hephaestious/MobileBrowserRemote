Express server to execute key presses on another computer.

# How to add commands
1. Make a python script in /python/. 
2. Inside the python file put the following:
  from keys import *
  keypress(commands) #commands: ctrl() shift() alt() enter() key() you can chain these any way you want just put the whole       thing in a keypress call
3. Copy paste the 'up' button and javascript and replace it with the name of the python file sans .py
4. Put this in index.js
  app.get('commandname', function(req, res){
    execute('pythonscriptname')
  })
  you should be able to figure it out by looking around
5. Run index.js
6. Go to (localip or localhost):8080

Notes:
when you do keystring() any special characters will cause errors and look weird, so what you want to do is find the key code (xev in ubuntu) then add it to the specials dictionary in keys.py like so: 'specialcharacter':keypresses, ex: '!': shift(key('exclam'))
